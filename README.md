The aim of Operation.asm was develop knowledge about timer, counter and interruptions, specialy 'TC0'.
The project was with a display with seven segments to create a stopwatch decreasing in seconds. When the start switch is pressed, the display of seconds(0 to 9) should start decrementing the numeber 9 until reaches 0 at the rate of 1 second. When it reaches the value 0, the displat should blink at a frequency of 1 Hz during 3 seconds. Activating the switch stop, during the process of countdown, should stop the sequence and the dot should blink at a frequency of 1 Hz. If it passes 10 seconds and the stop switch isn't pressed again, the stopwatch should end and the letter 'E' must be on the display for 3 seconds. If the switch stop is pressed during the period of 10 seconds, the stopwatch should continue counting until reaches 0. At the initial stage or when the Operation isn't being used the display must have the value '0'.
